# Distributed Matrix Multiplication with MPI

This repository contains the implementation and experiments of **distributed matrix multiplication using MPI (OpenMPI)**, executed on a **cluster of 5 laptops**.

The main objective is to **measure and compare the execution time** of square matrix multiplication for different matrix sizes, varying the number of MPI processes (`-np`).

📌 **Note:**
- **Node0 (Laptop)** acts as the master node: it compiles, launches experiments, and stores results.
- The remaining nodes only execute MPI processes.

## ⚙️ Implementation

### `matmul.c`

C program that:

- Implements square matrix multiplication `N × N`
- Divides the workload by **rows among MPI processes**
- Uses:
  - `MPI_Scatter` to distribute rows of matrix A
  - `MPI_Bcast` to broadcast matrix B
  - `MPI_Gather` to collect the final result
- **Prints nothing**, except:
  - A single number: the **wall time** measured using `MPI_Wtime()` by process `rank 0`

This allows automated benchmarking without extra output noise.

## 🧪 Automated Benchmark

### `benchmark_mpi.pl`

Perl script that automates the experiments:

- Matrix sizes tested:
200 × 200
400 × 400
800 × 800
1600 × 1600
3200 × 3200

- Number of MPI processes:
-np 4
-np 20


- For each combination:
  - Executes the multiplication **30 times**
  - Captures execution time
  - Saves results into `.csv` files

Example generated file:
LaptopNode0/Resultados/matricesde800_np20.csv

## 📊 Result Analysis

The experimental results generated by `benchmark_mpi.pl` are stored as `.csv` files for each configuration `(N, np)`.

To perform a rigorous statistical and performance analysis, we developed the notebook:

![**`Análisis_de_Resultados_MPI.ipynb`**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15WdVwPZxSTTRfs_gbFnocbjfzxU_HKDQ?usp=sharing)

This notebook processes the raw execution times and performs the full performance evaluation of the distributed algorithm.


### 🔎 What the Notebook Does

1. **Computes Statistical Metrics**
   - Mean execution time  
   - Standard deviation  
   - 95% confidence intervals (Student’s t-distribution)  

2. **Calculates Parallel Performance Metrics**
   - Speedup (relative to `np = 4`)
   - Parallel efficiency
   - Ideal execution time under linear scalability assumption
   - Overhead estimation (difference between observed and ideal time)

3. **Generates Visualizations**
   - Time vs Matrix Size plots (with confidence intervals)
   - Heatmaps of average execution times
   - Speedup comparison plots
   - Efficiency curves
   - Overhead behavior across problem sizes
     

### 📄 Complementary Technical Report

This repository also includes the full academic report:

![**`Taller-1_SD_Ramirez-Aponte-Pico-Arboleda-Losada-Santos-Rendon.pdf`**](Taller-1_SD_Ramirez-Aponte-Pico-Arboleda-Losada-Santos-Rendon.pdf)

The PDF provides:

- Theoretical background (Distributed Systems, MPI, Clusters)
- Formal definitions of performance metrics
- Mathematical formulations
- Experimental design and methodology
- Hardware specifications of the 5-node cluster
- Interpretation of the obtained results
- Limitations and scalability discussion
- Final conclusions

While the **notebook focuses on computational analysis and visualization**, the **PDF provides the formal theoretical and academic foundation** behind the experiment.

Together, they provide a complete evaluation of distributed matrix multiplication performance using MPI.
